## Stone Atomata Maze Challenge

The challenge was to find a **path** for a particle in a [cellular automaton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton) from the starting position (top left corner) to the finishing position (bottom right).

The animation below can give you a feeling for it.

At the time this challenge came out, I has about 2 weeks of experience with Rust, but decided to give it try!

Tuned out to be an amazing experience. My first experience ever in a programming challenge, actually.
