### Stone Atomata Maze Challenge

The challenge was to find a path for a particle in a cellular automaton from the starting position (top left corner) to the finishing position (bottom right).

The animation below can give you a feeling for it.

At the time this challenge came out, I has about 2 weeks of experience with Rust, but decided to give it try!

Tuned out to be an amazing experience. My first experience ever in a programming challenge, actually.
